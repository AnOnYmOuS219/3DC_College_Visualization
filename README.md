# <ins>3D-C: College Visualization</ins>

We all have experienced the phase of being locked at our homes with zero social connections and no travelling to schools, colleges and work places suring COVID phase. 

**Now imagine, how about if we can see our work places, our colleges, schools sitting at our homes? Intriguing! Isn't it?**

This being a basis of our motivation to research and build a computationally stable application which can be used by students to view their campus sitting at home.

### Tech used

We use the following technologies for our android project:
* Kotlin programming
* Firebase storage
* ARCore
* VR-SDK
* Blender Graphics tool
* MVP architecture pattern

### How to use this application?

After going through several iterations of improving the accuracy of model rendering, reducing memory usage for rendering, the results weren't that impressive. That's why the app was never published to the app store.

Essentially, the project can be cloned or downloaded and directly be used in the Android Studio.
